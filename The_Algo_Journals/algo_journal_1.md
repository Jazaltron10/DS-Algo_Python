##### Guidelines for making an algorithm
+ an algorithm should have a clear problem statement, input, and output. 
+ an algorithm definition must contain a specific set of instructions in a specific order
+ The steps in an algorithm need to be distinct each step in our algorithm must not be a 
  complex one, and needs to be explicitly clear.
+ algorithms should produce a result 
+ the algorithm should actually complete and should not take an infinite amount of time


###### consistent results for the same set of values is how we know that an 
algorithm is correct
####### correctness and efficiency
+ best case 
+ average case
+ worst case 

######## Big O
This is the theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size 

 ####### Recursion 
 + A recursive function is one that calls it's self 
 + The number of times a recursive function calls itself is called **Recursive Depth**

###### Space Complexity 
+ This is a measure of how much working storage or extra storage is needed as a partucular 
  algorithm grows.
+ This is concerned with the extra storage that is needed as the algorithm runs and 
  tries to find a solution.
