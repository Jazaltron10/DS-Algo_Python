# Guidelines for making an algorithm
+     An algorithm should have a clear problem statement, input, and output. 
+     An algorithm definition must contain a specific set of instructions in a specific order
+     The steps in an algorithm need to be distinct each step in our algorithm must not be a complex one, and needs to be explicitly clear.
+     Algorithms should produce a result 
+     The algorithm should actually complete and should not take an infinite amount of time


>## consistent results for the same set of values is how we know that an algorithm is correct
### correctness and efficiency
+     best case 
+     average case
+     worst case 

>## Big O
    This is the theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size (of its inputs)

>## Recursion 
 +      A recursive function is one that calls it's self 
 +      The number of times a recursive function calls itself is called Recursive Depth

>## Space Complexity 
+     This is a measure of how much working storage or extra storage is needed as a partucular algorithm grows.
+     This is concerned with the extra storage that is needed as the algorithm runs and tries to find a solution.
